<p>Pharmacies have different set of challenges compared to other retail stores. Hence their concerns are not generally addressed by POS and ERP solutions made for other retail stores. Pharmacies must manage and distribute drugs according to local laws and regulations. This means managing expiry dates of inventory effectively, handling prescription drugs according to local regulations etc.

Drugstores are also expected to give dosage instructions to customers and provide a fast and courteous service. On the other side, margins on pharmaceuticals keep on thinning, making the drugstores to be increasingly selective on the choice of inventory.
